# Data Structure: DisjointForrestSet()

Background: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is called a node and is connected to the next one using pointers. Unlike array, elements of linked list are stored in random memory locations. 

### Functions
find_root() - Finds the root (representative) of the set that an element belongs to.

union_by_size() - Merges the sets containing two elements using the union by size heuristic.

num_of_sets() - Returns the number of disjoint sets.

check_same_set() - Checks if two elements belong to the same set.

display() - Prints the internal representation of the Disjoint Set Forest.
