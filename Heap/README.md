# Data Structure: Heap()

Background: is a complete binary-tree data structure structured as an array with indexes as nodes. Heap has children and parent nodes in the binrary-tree representation in array strucutre. Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

### Functions
parent() - Returns the index of the parent node.

left_child() - Returns the index of the left child node, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

right_child() - Returns the index of the right child node, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

insert() - Inserts a new item into the heap, maintaining the heap property (overloaded).\
add() - Inserts a new item into the heap, maintaining the heap property (overloaded).

display() - Prints the elements of the heap.
